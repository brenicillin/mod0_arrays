## Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

- This has been the toughest so far, and I definitely ran into some productive struggle during this lesson. Now that I'm through it, I do feel much more comfortable working with arrays, but will definitely be practicing tonight.

2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

- I want to take some time once I've finished my work for the day and write down more methods and learn what they do and how they work.

3. What questions do you have about Arrays?

- I can't think of any questions at the moment but if I do I'm going to be sure to post them in Slack.
